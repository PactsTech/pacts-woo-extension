Pacts Payment Gateway for WooCommerce. The only trust-minimized decentralized Web3 payment processor for e-commerce.

== Description ==

The Pacts payment gateway allows you to accept payments across numerous chains. The extension allows users to submit orders to your order processor contract without leaving the checkout page. No jarring redirects, no iframes, it simply opens their web3 wallet.

The setup is very minimal. Once installed, simply going to Pacts settings page and input your desired currency and the addresses you have deployed to. Pacts will do the rest.

More detailed instructions can be found at our [docs](https://docs.pacts.tech).

**In order for us to process the transactions submitted via this extension, you must have an active [pacts subscription](https://app.pacts.tech/subscribe).**

While Pacts supports any ERC20 token, this extension bundles `USDC` and `USDT` integrations, with more currency support coming soon.
